  PARTNER PROGRAM

  Thank you for your interest in learning more about Vinna's Partner Program

  How it Works
  Only after completion of a sale to one of our Members, Vinna will automatically withdraw 10% of the total sale.
  Out of that 10%, 7% automatically returns to our Members.

  Advantages
  1. Word of Mouth, the most powerful form of advertising
  According to Forbes, 92% of consumers admit that they would buy Products and Services recommedned by family and friends.

  2. Zero investment risk and 100% guarantee in result
  In Vinna, business owners pay their advertising budget to their customer, but after, and only after the sale was completed.

  3. Fully tax deductible
  All the money that Associated Businesses pay to Vinna is in its entirety tax deductible as a budget invested in promotion.

  4. Unlimited range
  Now you are exposed to millions of Promoters working to expand the reach of your business in an unlimited way

  IMPORTANT: If you own more than one business just create another Partner Profile, there is no limit on how many Businesses you connect to Vinna.
