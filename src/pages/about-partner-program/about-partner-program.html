          PARTNER PROGRAM<br>
          Thank you for your interest in learning more about Vinna's Partner Program<br>

          How it Works<br>
          Only after completion of a sale to one of our Members, Vinna will automatically withdraw 10% of the total sale.
          Out of that 10%, 7% automatically returns to our Members.<br>

          Advantages<br>
          1. Word of Mouth, the most powerful form of advertising<br>
          According to Forbes, 92% of consumers admit that they would buy Products and Services recommedned by family and friends.<br>

          2. Zero investment risk and 100% guarantee in result<br>
          In Vinna, business owners pay their advertising budget to their customer, but after, and only after the sale was completed.<br>

          3. Fully tax deductible<br>
          All the money that Associated Businesses pay to Vinna is in its entirety tax deductible as a budget invested in promotion.<br>

          4. Unlimited range<br>
          Now you are exposed to millions of Promoters working to expand the reach of your business in an unlimited way.<br>

          IMPORTANT: If you own more than one business just create another Partner Profile, there is no limit on how many Businesses you connect to Vinna.<br>
